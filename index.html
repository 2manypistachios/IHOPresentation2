                    4.	There is only limited number of options to cover the uninsured:
                    <li>mandatory insurance requirements</li>
                    <li>high deductible plans</li>
                    <li>high costs of insurance policies</li>
                    <li>higher taxes</li>
                    <li>increased national debt. </li>
                    <li>Each of these options has many opponents.</li>

                    5.	In 2018, the overall Medicare cost was $582 billion. In 2018, there were about 55 million Medicare members. Thus, the annual cost of Medicare per member in 2018 was about $10,600.
